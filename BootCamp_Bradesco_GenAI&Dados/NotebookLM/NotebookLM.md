> **Tools:** Google NotebookLM, Gemini 1.5 Pro

## 🧐 Overview

This project leverages **Google's NotebookLM** to synthesize, analyze, and generate insights on complex quantitative finance strategies. By curating high-level financial literature and technical documentation, I created a specialized knowledge base to explore the mathematical foundations of algorithmic trading.

The primary goal was to test the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interpreting financial formulas, risk metrics, and market hypotheses based on **curated source materials**, evaluating their **pedagogical ability** to explain complex concepts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Google NotebookLM:** RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine for source synthesis.
* **Markdown/LaTeX:** For documentation (Created with gemini 1.5).
